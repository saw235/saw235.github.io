## Real-time Image Filtering using FPGA
> This is my final project done for Advanced Digital Design class, I implemented two 3x3 sliding window filters in the Nexys4-ddr board. 

Because the path delay of the DSP-components easily exceeds the timing contraints, I have came up with a FSM controller to pipeline the 2D-convolution process.
