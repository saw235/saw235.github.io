Finally got the motivation to come back and do some updates to this blog. I can't believe it. It has actually been two years since I last updated!
As you can see, I have opted into using this minimalistic Lagrange theme.

I thought about using a Medium-ish kind of theme but have decided against it at this point in time. It does look a lot more nicer but I wanted to focus on actually building quality blog content first instead of hiding underneath a nice blog UI.

Anyhow the last two years has been really busy and I've managed to get myself into an even busier schedule by juggling between work, friends and side projects. I have finally gotten into the groove of things and seriously vow to keep updating this blog at least once per month! I have always wanted to complete the eulerproject math/code challenges so I think I will start with those.
